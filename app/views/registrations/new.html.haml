      %h2 New User Registration
      %p As a registered site user, you will be able to take part in shaping the OFX standard by commenting on proposed standard changes. Registration is moderated; you will not have full access to user-accessible information until your sign-up has been confirmed by an administrator.
      %h3 Open Effects Association Membership
      %p Membership in the OFX Association is open to companies implementing or interested in promoting and extending the OpenFX standard.  The membership fee is currently Â£500/year (~600&euro;, ~$800). New corporate members are generally admitted at the annual meeting, in April of each year.  If you wish to join, please contact the Association using our #{link_to 'contact form', contact_form_path}. 
      
      %p NOTE: You do not need to be an Association member to implement the standard either as a host or as a plug-in; it is completely open source and open to all.  
      
      %p You may participate in discussions using the #{mail_to 'ofx-discussion@groups.google.com', 'Google mailing list'} and download the source code and examples from our public #{link_to 'github', 'https://github.com/ofxa/openfx', :target => '_blank'}. Open-source contributions are also accepted from non-members.
