We'll have breakfast options, including coffee, tea, juice, pastries, and bagels to get you started. We've observed that the well prepared often have chairs, an umbrella or awning to escape the sun, and perhaps some refreshments. The folks at Lakeside farms have a great selection of lunch options, and strawberries are in season!
