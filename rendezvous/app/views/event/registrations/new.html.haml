        %p Sorry, we're glad you're eager, but we're not quite ready for registration yet.
        %p We'll let you know through the usual channels when it's registration is open.
        %p Thanks for your patience!

                Before we begin, we want to be up front that we've raised the fee to $75 for adults. Everything seems to cost more these days, and as a result the Rendezvous is no different, plus we have several unpredictable line items: the auction, the merch, the number of people coming. 
              %p 
                Thank you for your understanding.
              %p
                Now on with the show: if you've registered previously, we've already filled in your basic information. Let us know who you're bringing, if anyone. Then we'll give you a chance to review, followed by payment.
