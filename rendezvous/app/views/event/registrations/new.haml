                Lakeside have informed us that our expenses with them are up by %10 over last year, so this years registration fee is $#{event_fee}.
              %p 
                Thank you for your understanding.

                If you've previously registered, we've already filled in your basic information. We are now using Square to process credit cards, so address is no longer required.
              %p 
                Let us know who you're bringing, if anyone. Then we'll give you a chance to review, followed by payment.
