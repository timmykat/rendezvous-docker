        %p Since people don't log in more than once a year, we've dispensed with passwords and are using login links. This is how it works: 
        %ul
          %li Submit your account email below.
          %li We'll send a link to that email account with a login token good for 10 minutes
          %li  
            %em If you don't see the email in your inbox, please check your spam folder!
          %li Click on the link and you'll be in like Flynn.

        %p 
          If you don't have an account, before you register, you need to create one. 
          %a{ href: new_user_registration_path } Create a user.

        %p
          NOTE: Some people are having problems logging in or registering. If you're not getting a login email, please check your spam folder. Otherwise, please use the 
          %a{ href: "/Rendezvous-registration-2024.pdf" } alternative registration form
          and send with payment to the indicated address.
