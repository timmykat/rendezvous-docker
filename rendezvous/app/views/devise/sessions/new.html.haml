        %p Since people don't log in more than once a year, we've dispensed with passwords and are using login links. This is how it works: 
        %ul
          %li Submit your account email below.
          %li We'll send a link to that email account with a login token good for 10 minutes
          %li  
            %em If you don't see the email in your inbox, please check your spam folder!
          %li Click on the link and you'll be in like Flynn.

        %p 
          If you don't have an account,
          %a{ href: new_user_registration_path } sign up here.
