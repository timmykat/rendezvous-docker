            %p Since people don't log in more than once a year, we've dispensed with passwords and are using login links.

            %h2.h4 How does it work?
            %ul
              %li Enter your account email above.
              %li We'll send a link to that email account which will be good for 10 minutes
              %li  
                %em If you don't see the email in your inbox, please check your spam folder!
              %li As a security measure, we don't notify you if you've used an incorrect email.
              %li Click on the link and you'll be in like Flynn.

            %p
              NOTE: Some people are having problems logging in or registering. If you're not getting a login email, please check your spam folder. Otherwise, please use the 
              %a{ href: "/Rendezvous-registration-#{Date.current.year}.pdf" } alternative registration form
              and send with payment to the indicated address.
